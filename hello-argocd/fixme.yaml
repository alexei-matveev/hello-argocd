# Just ä comment.   Hm, the problem with Unicode text  like "üäß" does
# not seem to affect v2.0.4 when  the Application is confugured to use
# "Directory"  as a  manifest provider.   The bug  was reported  for a
# Kustomization project and ArgoCD v2.0.0 [1].
#
# The moment you  add add kustomization.yaml listing this  secret as a
# resource you will get the error message:
#
#     yaml: invalid trailing UTF-8 octet
#
# A side effect will be that your Jsonnet files will be ignored as the
# manifest provider changes apparently to "Kustomize".
